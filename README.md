# Utilities for Activities at Scale Modeling Events

This is my set of utilities and such for supporting activities (contests, etc.) held by [IPMS/USA](http://www.ipmsusa.org) and affiliated chapters. I hope to keep it generic-enough that I also (eventually) have tools for other styles of shows and contests.

Right now, there is only one utility, `contest_tool.pl`, which is used to manage the photos of contest category winners and create an ordered sequence of the photos that can be used as a slideshow presentation. The tool is fairly simple and (currently) lacking in documentation. This tool is geared for standard (first-second-third) contests. If there is demand for it, I may modify it (or use it as the basis) for use with Open System judging.

My plan is for this repository to eventually have a variety of tools for all/most activities that a chapter/club would need tools for.
