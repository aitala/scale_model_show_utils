# ipmsutils - Utilities for IPMS activities

This is my set of utilities and such for supporting activities (contests, etc.) held by [IPMS/USA](http://www.ipmsusa.org) and affiliated chapters.

Right now, there is only one utility, `contest_tool.pl`, which is used to manage the photos of contest category winners and create an ordered sequence of the photos that can be used as a slideshow presentation. The tool is fairly simple and (currently) lacking in documentation.

My plan is for this repository to eventually have a variety of tools for all/most activities that a chapter would need tools for.
